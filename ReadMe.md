# Earthquake Predictions!

### Data sets:
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1tM6G2SvNANlIiNguy4qLXHTNzmr1bD95 <br>
The earthquake data set is 3.8 million rows. <br>
The earthquake_data_notype_23col is 1.3 million rows, no null values or malformed rows, and only type earthquake events.<br>
The earthquake_data_standardized is earthquake_data_23 but all numerical columns divided by their max value.<br>

### To Do:
- ~~create script to query API~~
- ~~create script to clean and learn about retrieved data~~
- ~~use data to create models and visuals(multivariate linear regression, Neural Network, KNN, Decision Tree)~~ 
- ~~Re-retrieve data since some API calls returned a 429 code~~
- Create effective and more data visualizations
- ~~Implement Gradient Descent on Linear Regression~~
- Improve Gradient Descent on Linear Regression
- ~~Research and implement Multivariate Polynomial Regression~~
- Implement Gradient Descent on Polynomial Regression
- ~~Create CSV with standardized columns~~
- ~~Create CSV with standardized columns and standardized time~~
- Seismograph data?
- Create Convolutonal Neural Network Model with Seismograph Data
- Create Decision Tree Model
- ~~Implement Random Forest Model~~
- ~~Continue Research on Past Work for Presentation~~
- Round/classify magnitudes to increase accuracy
- Ensemble?
